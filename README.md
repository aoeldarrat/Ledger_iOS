## Ledgers
A ledger is a book, a self contained item which serves as a record for book keeping, invoicing, financial balancing, Reciept collection, etc. Inside of each ledger can be one or multiple items or records. 

Example
- User collects all expenses and incomes for a given year. They create a ledger named 2021. Each expense and income is then added the ledger. The user then generates a pdf and exports it to his phone's files to later print.
